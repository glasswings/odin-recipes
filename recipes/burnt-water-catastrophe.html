        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sometimes I don't plan ahead as well as I should and find myself needing a quick snack. Usually this works out well, but sometimes it doesn't. This dish requires an unusual combination of foresight and the ability to nevertheless put one's foot <em>right</em> in it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Canned pumpkin puree, approximately 15 ounce or 400 mL size.</li>
            <li>Maple syrup, 60 ml</li> 
            <li>A good amount of pumpkin pie spice</li>
            <li>Forethought</li>
            <li>Good intentions</li>
            <li>One teakettle with sentimental value</li>
            <li>Cup instant noodles</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Begin by mixing the pumpkin, syrup, and spice.</li>
            <li>Spread the mixture thin on dehydrating trays and thoroughly dehydrate.</li>
            <li>Seal in serving-sized bags and keep in an airtight container.</li>
            <li>Stay up too late studying and/or hacking on something interesting.</li>
            <li>Realize, oops, you're hungry.</li>
            <li>Decide to make yourself a cup of instant noodles, and also some of that camping pumpkin pudding for variety.</li>
            <li>Heat water for instant noodles.</li>
            <li>Pour.</li>
            <li>Set timer for 3 minutes, wander off to look at that code one more time.</li>
            <li>Come back to timer.</li>
            <li>Enjoy noodles</li>
            <li>What's that smell?</li>
            <li>Oh... <i>dang it.</i> I was gonna make pudding from roughly equal parts hot water and dehydrated pumpkin pie filling.</li>
            <li>And I liked that kettle.</li>
