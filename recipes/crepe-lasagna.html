        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lasagna. I love lasagna as much as the next American, but if you ask me about the one thing I don't love, it's when the edges of the pasta get a little too dry and turn back into pasta-leather, y'know? Crepe lasagna solves that: instead of pasta that gets hard when it dries out, you've got crepes. They're much more able to survive a bit of extra toasting in the oven.</p>
        <p>Only problem then: what are crepes? To be honest, I don't really know! I'm the STEM person and rely&mdash;heavily rely&mdash;on a Franco-American boyfriend to take care of things like that.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, this dish is reasonably easy. It's a slow-cooking style, so you do a little bit of work then you can go do something else for a while while it sits and smells amazing.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-12 crepes in the fridge<br>
                (the kind your boyfriend or roommate makes too many of)</li>
            <li>150g of dry mozzarella, or more to taste, shredded</li>
            <li>ragù alla bolognese or make a batch from</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 medium red onion, or yellow, chopped</li>
                <li>150g of celery, chopped</li>
                <li>400g of carrot, chopped </li>
                <li>150g of tomato paste</li>
                <li>400g of peeled tomatoes</li>
                <li>1L of smooth tomato puree</li>
                <li>300g of beef, ground</li>
                <li>200g of veal, ground</li>
                <li>salt & pepper</li>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>red table wine</li>
                <li>whole milk</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If you have the ragù ready, skip to step 14, otherwise select a large stock pot, 12 or 16 liters is about right.</li>
            <li>Coat the bottom of the pot with a generous pour of olive oil and gently preheat.</li>
            <li>Add chopped onion and cook a few minutes until golden.</li>
            <li>Add celery and carrot. Continue to cook at a medium-high heat to develop the flavor of these aromatics, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add about 100 mL of wine. Evaporate off the alcohol.</li>
            <li>Add meat.</li>
            <li>As the meat browns, stir it to break it apart.</li>
            <li>Allow the juices from the meat to reduce&mdash;you want the water to evaporate before adding more liquid.</li>
            <li>Add another 100 mL of wine and evaporate it.</li>
            <li>Add tomato products. Wash remaining tomato from the containers with a bit of extra water.</li>
            <li>The key to any tomato sauce is patience, allowing it to cook for most of a day. Three hours is a minimum, but longer is better. Reduce heat to a light simmer, cover and occasionally check if more water is needed.</li>
            <li>Add salt and pepper to taste at some point.</li>
            <li>Allow the ragù to cool before continuing. It can be warm or chilled but you don't want to burn yourself during assembly.</li>
            <li>Select a lasagna pan, about 25x30 cm or 10x12 inches. Preheat oven to 175C or 350F.</li>
            <li>Start with a thin layer of ragù, then layer crepe, ragù, mozzarella. Repeat layers until the pan is filled.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If the crepes are an awkward size for the pan, feel free to cut and overlap them. They will all melt together once baked.</li>
                <li>Keep the sauce and cheese layers thin - thinner than you would need in a pasta lasagna,</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake for about 40-60 minutes until cheese bubbles and sauce starts to simmer.</li>
        </ol>
