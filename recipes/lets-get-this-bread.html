    <h1>&#8220;Let's Get This&#8221; Rye Bread</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rye bread is so named because of the distinctive tangy flavor it gets from caraway seeds. I know this doesn't make perfect sense, but those are the rules; I don't make them. Coincidentally this flavor note is balanced by the earthiness of rye flour, but don't make the same mistake I have in the past. Literal &#8220;rye&#8221; bread without wheat flower is more of a rye <em>biscuit</em> or <em>hardtack.</em></p>
    <p>This bread; however, aspires to a &#8220;let's get this&#8221; vigor. For that purpose a sourdough would be ideal, but I have to admit I baked the entire sourdough colony last time and the new one is still a tad uncouth. As is typical with homemade bread recipes, the quantities are approximate and should be adjusted by feel. Go forth and get the bread that is <em>yours</em>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>active dry yeast</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>100g rye flour</li>
        <li>600g bread flour</li>
        <li>light molasses</li>
        <li>20g of salt</li> 
        <li>30g of caraway seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-mix the flour blend. You don't have to do this; you can also eyeball the amount of rye to wheat.</li>
        <li>Let's start this bread with a pouliche, an overnight pre-ferment. Start with about 200mL of water, little bit of molasses a pinch of yeast, and gently stir in enough flour to make a pudding texture. Cover with a moist towel and let it go 12-24 hours.</li>
        <li>Dissolve salt into another 200-300mL of water and stir in to loosen the dough to its most liquid state.</li>
        <li>Stir in caraway seeds.</li> 
        <li>Stir in flour. How much? Enough to make a sticky dough.</li>
        <li>Let rise for about an hour.</li>
        <li>Now let's get this kneaded, gently!</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dust the surface with flour, enough to make it not quite so sticky. Peel it up from the bowl and get the bottom side too.</li>
            <li>Stretch it but don't tear, then fold across the direction you stretch.</li>
            <li>Turn, do the other direction.</li>
            <li>Get three or four stretch-fold cycles in</li>
            <li>Flip the dough over so that the folds sit on the bottom and a nice smooth surface on top.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Allow another half hour of rising time and repeat until you've done a total of three or four kneading cycles.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 250C with the lid of a dutch oven inside. You can preheat the dutch oven for better results, but you'll have to be careful when you put the loaf in.</li>
        <li>But I'm a bit more cautious and prefer to let the loaf rise for the final time inside a cool dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Score the top of the loaf with a razor.</li>
        <li>Bake, covered, for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cover and bake for about another 15 minutes, to an internal temperature of 90C.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly cool.</li>
    </ol>
